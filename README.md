# Booking System

This is a booking system where instructors can set their availability slots, and students can view and book available slots. The system uses **React.js** for the frontend, **Node.js** for the backend, and **Firebase** for data storage.

## Features
- **Instructor** can set and update their availability slots.
- **Student** can view available slots and book them.
- **Validation** is implemented to avoid double-booking.
- Firebase is used for storing availability and bookings.

## Installation

Follow these steps to clone the repository and install all necessary dependencies.

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   
2. **Install Backend and Frontend Dependencies**

   Since this project contains both frontend (React) and backend (Node.js), you'll need to install dependencies for both.

   For Backend (Node.js):
   If you have a separate backend folder, navigate to it and install dependencies.

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

   For Frontend (React):
   Go back to the root folder and install the frontend dependencies.

   
   ```bash
   cd ..
   npm install
